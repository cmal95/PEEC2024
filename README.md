Project: determining radial velocities of stars with exoplanets

This repository has the codes, values and results I used and obtained for the project. 

vsini_code.py is the code that derives vsini

correction_vr.py is the code that corrects de radial velocity of the spectra

plotspectra.py is a code to see plots of the values of the spectra

Figures is a folder with all the plots and figures I used to show the results and to complete the report

linelist and mpfit folders have values and functions necessary in vsini_code.py

2ndpart.ipynb is a jupyter notebbok used to analyse the seconde group of stars

Final_results.ipynb is a jupyter notebook with all the results organized and the plots for each 

Rascunho.ipynb is a jupyter notebook with some first functions 

exp_stars_information.csv is the file used to put the stars information from which the code goes to obtain in it

limb_values.csv is the file used in the interpolation for the limb darkening coefficients

listwrongresults.csv is the file with the results for the stars that didn't work well

listwrongs.csv is the file with the information of the stars with wrong results

literatures1stgroup.csv and literature2ndgroup.csv are the files with the literature values for the different groups of stars

results1stgroup.csv and results2ndgroup.csv are the files with the results for each group of stars

stars1stgroup.csv and stars2ndgroup.csv are the files with the information of the groups of stars
